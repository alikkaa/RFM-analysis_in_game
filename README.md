**Initial data:**
Purchase data – October 2018-June 2019 – file “Purchases.csv”

# Task 1. Carry out RFM analysis (Practical task)

Based on the initial data (the “Purchases” file), conduct an RFM analysis of user behavior.
Segmentation of players by duration, number and amount of payments for RFM analysis is below:
By recency:
from 0 to 10 days ago - 'recently paid'; from 11 to 30 days - 'paid a while ago'; more than 30 days ago - 'paid long ago'.
In count:
1 purchase - 'only 1 payment'; 2-5 purchases - 'pay rarely'; 6-20 purchases - 'pay sometimes'; more than 20 purchases - 'pay frequently'.
By payment amount:
up to 20− 'minnows';20−100 - 'dolphins'; 100-500 - 'whales'; more than 500 - 'grand whales'.

Form conclusions and proposals based on the results of the RFM analysis.
It should be taken into account that the results of the analysis are used for the subsequent use of various tools for working with different payment segments of the audience, for example, sending push notifications to users, issuing gifts, for creating retargeting campaigns and other subsequent work with different segments of users.

# Task 2 (Methodological)
Since February 5, there has been a decrease in Retention 1.3d indicators for all users by 2 percentage points. (for other periods Retention also fell).
**Goal:** to determine the reasons for the decline in Retention. Develop a set of recommendations to solve the problem.

**What you need to do in this task:** write a description of how you will analyze this problem situation.

**What does a good solution look like?**
- Formulate valuable hypotheses
- Test hypotheses
- Describe in the form of diagrams the process of testing hypotheses, possible test results and subsequent actions based on the results obtained.
- Possible design in the form of block diagrams
